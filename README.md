# Histosnip

HistoSnip is a WIP pet project chrome extension that's really two projects in one:

**Snippet Finder:** 
A snippet is the small piece of text under the link of a google search result. When you click on a search result, the extension scrolls you automatically to where the snippet appears in the webpage (if it exists in the page). It saves the annoying copy and find you have to do when a Google snippet contains the exact information you need but then the result page opens at the top of the page.
Framework is completely Google's chrome extension API. There is no backend.

**History By Topic:**
Extension records and groups browse history by topic/webpage content. 
Framework is the chrome extension API as the frontend and the backend is the Python Flask SQLAlchemy framework.

To run backend:
#Start up server with flask shell
#Run with flask run
